# About Buddy.me

**Buddy.me** is more than just a productivity app—it’s a **personal journey tracker** designed to empower you as you grow, learn,
and achieve your goals. Inspired by my own experiences building systems and designing intuitive, self-explanatory products, Buddy.me
is built around **affordance-driven UX**—every element is designed to guide you naturally without needing extensive documentation or tutorials.

### What is Buddy.me?

Buddy.me is a **gamified progress-tracking and social support app** that helps you stay on track with your personal growth and milestones.
Whether you're tackling a long-term project, learning a new skill, or maintaining a healthy habit, Buddy.me provides a supportive environment
where progress is celebrated, feedback is immediate, and every step taken is a reward in itself.

It’s built on the **principles of gamification** and **intentional UX design**, combining **visual rewards**, **goal streaks**, and a
**transparent design system** to create an engaging experience. Every interaction with the app is meaningful, ensuring that users stay
motivated and connected to their goals, whether solo or in a community.

### The Story Behind Buddy.me

**Buddy.me** is a product of passion—a combination of my love for **clean UI design**, **scalable infrastructure**, and the challenge of
solving meaningful problems through **code**. As an engineer and designer, I wanted to build something that would help people track their
personal progress without adding unnecessary complexity to their lives.

Having worked across multiple domains—**from full-stack development** to **cloud infrastructure**, and even **open-source contributions**—I
understand the value of clear design, reliable systems, and a good user flow. I wanted to create an app that was not only functional but
**deeply user-focused**, something that integrates seamlessly into your routine and is rewarding to use every day.

### Why I Built It

While working on other projects like **Snapflow** and contributing to **open-source communities** at GitLab, I kept seeing the same issue:
people struggle to maintain motivation and track incremental progress. There’s a lot of focus on productivity tools, but few focus on
**sustainable, long-term habits** or **social accountability**. I saw an opportunity to **merge gamification with self-revealing UX**,
creating something that doesn't just tell you what to do but helps you understand why you're doing it and how it impacts your bigger goals.

Buddy.me is designed to fill that gap—making the **journey** of achieving goals as meaningful as the **outcome**. It’s a digital companion
that supports you in a way that traditional to-do lists and task managers never could.

### Core Values

- **Transparency**: The development of Buddy.me is an open process. I document every step of the journey publicly on GitHub and share
regular updates on the blog to keep users and the community involved in the iterative design process.
- **Simplicity**: Every design choice is intentional. The goal is to **minimize friction** and maximize engagement, so users can focus
on their goals, not the app itself.
- **Support**: Building in public means building with the community. I want Buddy.me to evolve with feedback from real users—because,
after all, the best progress happens together.

### What’s Next?

Buddy.me is still evolving. The current focus is on building a **scalable, fully gamified experience** that allows users to not just
track their progress but also interact with others who are on similar journeys. As I continue iterating and refining, there will be exciting
features like **social progress tracking**, **shared challenges**, and **customizable progress visuals** to keep the experience fresh
and motivating.

If you’re passionate about personal growth, **motivation systems**, and **community support**, then you’ll love what Buddy.me has to offer.
